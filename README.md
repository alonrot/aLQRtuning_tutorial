The following two videos summarize the benefits of our contribution, demonstrated on two robotic platforms:
1. [Robot arm balancing an inverted pole](https://youtu.be/TrGc4qp3pDM)
2. [Two-legged robot performing a squatting task](https://youtu.be/udJAK60IWEc)

The tutorials come with visualization tools and are self explanatory. Just follow the explanations.
